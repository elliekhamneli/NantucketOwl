  <h1>Mission</h1>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(192, 192, 237);font-size: 15px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Purpose</h1>
  <p> As a camp counselor, I’ve had plenty of experience working with kids. Over the years, I’ve created strong friendships with many of my campers. Many of them have aspirations that can change the world. However, the lack of support or resources inhibits some from following their dreams. My goal in raising money for the Nantucket Boys and Girls Clubs is to give everyone an opportunity to explore their passions. </p>

    <p>The Nantucket Boys & Girls Club is an organization that provides mentorship and support to help kids in our community succeed. Their forward-looking programming is designed to empower kids by giving them opportunities and experiences not restricted by individual circumstances. At the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club, kids are encouraged to try new things, explore their interests, and meet new people. Every child is treated with equal amounts of respect. I am supporting the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club because I believe every child should have an opportunity to make their dreams become a reality.
