  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
    <p>  Hi! My name is Owen Larson, and I am a rising junior at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York City. I’ve spent every summer in Nantucket since I was a baby, and it has really felt like a second home to me. I’ve created numerous friendships that will last a lifetime and fond memories I will never forget. I have been a camp counselor at Murray Camp for the past three years and love meeting new people. I started the Nantucket Owl Charity Cornhole Classic five years ago in the backyard of my house. From there, I’ve been able to expand the event year by year and was super grateful to be allowed to host it at the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club in 2022. I hope to continue developing the tournament into something special, something that will be cemented into the legacy of an island with so much history. I invite you all to come out to the Charity Cornhole Classic!
    </p>
